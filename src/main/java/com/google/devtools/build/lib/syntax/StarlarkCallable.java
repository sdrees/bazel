 * The StarlarkCallable interface is implemented by all Starlark values that may be called from

 *
 * <p>It defines two methods: {@code fastcall}, for performance, or {@code call} for convenience. By
 * default, {@code fastcall} delegates to {@code call}, and call throws an exception, so an
 * implementer may override either one.
